# tree

#What i did: for test task: create \ add \ delete a tree and one extra task - change the name of branch

#Descriptions:
#Function tree() will follow you on the every 'server' file, and i know this, and for best code style, i have to create a class, and work with him, take a note, please.
#The same problem with pg_connect...
#In this 'tree' i used bootstrap, just for modals, much jquery and a little php, you will see.
#And i have never before used a PHPDoc or something else for documentation.
